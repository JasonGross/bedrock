Non-dependent expression representation
---------------------------------------

Expr
    Simple non-dependent expression language (this is new: the representation
    in 'dep' had types which dependently encoded the free variables
    of an expression.)  Forms the basis for SepExpr. (XXX but what is it really??)
ExprUnify
NatMap
    Non-dependent unbalanced binary trees with natural numbers as keys
    (no values stored in leaves)
Provers
SepExpr/SepExprTests
SymEval
Unfolder/UnfolderTests
